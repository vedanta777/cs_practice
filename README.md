# cs_practice

This contains various programs that I have written during my time at IIIT Bhubaneshwar, pursuing BTech in CSE. 
I will add more folders and write alternate codes as I learn more about programming in C.

Currently the topics covered in these codes are - 
1. Arrays
2. Miscellaneous problems like the collatz conjecture
3. Memory management
